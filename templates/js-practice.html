  <h1>JavaScript Practice</h1>
  <p>
    For each numbered problem, fill in the corresponding section in the Javascript file
    to solve the problem. The location of this file is <strong>static/js-practice.js</strong>.</p>
  <p>
    <b>Note:</b> you should only be modifying that file; there is no need to modify this HTML file <b>at all</b>.

  <h3>Making an Event Handler</h3>
  <p>
    Make this button pop up an alert box in the
    browser window.
  </p>

  <fieldset>
    <input type="button" value="Show Me a Popup!" id="popup-alert-button">
  </fieldset>

  <h3>Practicing Your Times Tables</h3>
  <p>
    When the user submits the form below, by default it will go to <code>/nope</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    1) Prevent this from happening.
  </p>
  <p>
    2) Instead, read the values in from the form and create an array containing multiples of the requested number, up to
    (and including) the requested maximum.
  </p>
  <p>
    3) Print the array you have made to the console.
  </p>

  <fieldset>
    <form id="multiplying-form" action="/nope">
      I want all multiples of
      <select id="mults-of" name="mults-of">
        <option value="2">2</option>
        <option value="3">3</option>
        <option value="4">4</option>
        <option value="5">5</option>
        <option value="6">6</option>
        <option value="7">7</option>
        <option value="8">8</option>
        <option value="9">9</option>
      </select>
      up to
      <input id="max" type="number" name="up-to">.
      <input id="multiply-btn" type="submit" value="Go!">
    </form>

  </fieldset>

  <div class="hint">
    <div>
      You'll need to cast the form values to integers.
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>An Agreeable Form</h3>
  <p>
    When the user submits the form below, it should fill in the div to agree with the
    user. So if I say my favorite food is "pretzels," a message should appear in that div
    that says, "I like pretzels, too."
  </p>

  <fieldset>
    <form action="/oh-no-do-not-go-here" id="agreeable-form">
      What's your favorite food?
      <input type="text" name="favorite-food" required id="favorite-food-input">
      <input type="submit" value="I'm Very Agreeable">
    </form>
    <div id="agreeable-text"></div>
  </fieldset>

  <h3>Five Colored Primes</h3>
  <p>
    When the button is pushed, five new circles should appear in the bordered area. Each circle should contain the next
    prime number, starting with 2. (A prime number is an integer greater than 1 which cannot be divided evenly by any
    other number other than itself and 1. For example, 11 is prime (you can only divide it by 1 and 11), while 12 is not
    (you can divide it evenly by 2, 3, 4, and 6, along with 1 and 12).
  </p>
  <p>
    Each box should have a different color, chosen from the list of colors in the JavaScript. You can re-use our
    <code>prime-circle</code> class to make your numbers look like ours, if you want (or feel free to experiment with
    other CSS).
  </p>
  <p>The result should look like:</p>
  <div>
    <div class="prime-circle" style="background-color: orange">2</div>
    <div class="prime-circle" style="background-color: midnightblue">3</div>
    <div class="prime-circle" style="background-color: darkgoldenrod">5</div>
    <div class="prime-circle" style="background-color: green">7</div>
    <div class="prime-circle" style="background-color: purple">11</div>
  </div>
  <p>You must calculate the prime numbers; you cannot just hard-code them.</p>

  <fieldset>
    <div id="prime-circle-area">
      <!-- Your prime circles should appear here! -->
    </div>
    <input type="button" id="make-prime-circles" value="Button">
  </fieldset>

  <h2>AJAX</h2>

  <h3>Got Puppies?</h3>
  <p>
    Who doesn't like puppies? No one, that's who! Fortunately, we've written a server to serve up as many cute puppies
    as one could ask for!
  </p>
  <p>
    Write code so that when the user clicks the "I want puppies!" button, an AJAX request gets sent to the route
    <code>/puppies.json</code> with the requested number of puppies from the form below, keyed to the name
    "num-puppies." The route will return the URL of a photo with the specified number of puppies. We've provided a
    callback function, <code>showPuppies</code>, which will use the results to show the puppies in the
    <code>puppies-go-here</code> div below.
  </p>

  <fieldset>
    <form id="puppy-form">
      How many puppies would you like?
      <select id="num-puppies" name="num-puppies">
        <option value="1">1 puppy</option>
        <option value="2">2 puppies</option>
        <option value="3">3 puppies</option>
        <option value="lots">A pile of puppies!</option>
      </select>
      <input type="submit" value="I want puppies!">
    </form>
    <div id="puppies-go-here"></div>
  </fieldset>

  <div class="hint">
    <div>
      What type of request makes more sense here, GET or POST?
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>CSS Stuff</h2>
  <h3>Explore the CSS</h3>
    For those of you interested in more intermediate/complex
    CSS, take a look at the CSS we use on this page&mdash;it shows off some interesting pseudo-selectors like
    <code>:before</code> and uses things like CSS numbering.
